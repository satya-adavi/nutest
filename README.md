# Nutest

## Overview
Nutest is a repo containing basic algorithm implementations, file reading, and parallel function execution. This repository includes functions for calculating factorials, generating Fibonacci series, and reading data from files, all managed from a central `main.py` file.

## Contents
This repository contains the following Python files:

- **`factorial.py`**: Implements a function to calculate the factorial of a given number.
- **`fibonacci.py`**: Implements a function to generate a Fibonacci series up to a specified number.
- **`file_read.py`**: Contains a function to read input from a file located in a sub-folder.
- **`temp.py`**: Demonstrates parallel execution of two functions.
- **`main.py`**: The main entry point that orchestrates the execution of the other modules.

## Features
- **Factorial Calculation**: Calculate the factorial of any non-negative integer.
- **Fibonacci Series**: Generate the Fibonacci series for a given range.
- **File Input Handling**: Read input values from a specified file in a sub-folder for flexibility.
- **Parallel Function Execution**: Demonstrates how to run two functions concurrently.
